The AI Interview Preparation System creatively integrates Vapi's voice interface with Gemini's advanced language model to simulate realistic, real-time mock interviews. This voice-based interaction mirrors actual interview dynamics, offering users an immersive and personalized prep experience. Its real-world applicability is clear: it empowers job seekers to practice interviews for various roles (tech, business, etc.) anytime, anywhere, improving confidence and performance. Technically, it combines real-time speech-to-text, LLM-driven adaptive questioning, context-aware feedback, and dynamic scenario generationâ€”making it not only innovative but also technically robust and highly scalable for real-world deployment.
